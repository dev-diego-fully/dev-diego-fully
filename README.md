## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Diego**, a focused programmer currently studying IT at college.

At the moment, I'm diving deep into **Rust**, while also exploring languages like **Elixir**, **Go**, and **C++** that share similar paradigms. Additionally, I'm focusing on **Java** and **TypeScript** to strengthen my skills in high-demand technologies, with **C#** also on my radar.

**Lua** has a special place in my heart, though I haven't been programming in it recently as I'm currently prioritizing other languages.

Feel free to explore, learn, and collaborate!
